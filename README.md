Personal Portfolio Website
==========================

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website hosted at [davidmccleave.com](https://www.davidmccleave.com).
GoDaddy is used for hosting.

The webapp uses flask as a backend and HTML5, Tailwind CSS and vanilla Javascript for the frontend. THREE.js is a 3D animations framework
used on the frontend to display the "semi-optimizing" particles shown in the background of the webapp. These particles use weak
velocity and position update functions, where the social component is your cursor position and the cognitive component is generated
at random intervals for random particles as random positions within your view when looking at the webpage.
